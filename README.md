# SW2GDMLconverter
Program that converts a CAD design in SolidWorks to GDML format for importation into Geant4. Uses the SolidwWorks API.

The executable runs on Windows 7 and requires SolidWorks. The template.gdml file must exist in the current directory when the
converter is run. It is best to run it in a command prompt in order to see any error messages.
